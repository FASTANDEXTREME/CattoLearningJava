## 📝 About

This repository contains various **beginner to intermediate Java projects** that I've built while learning the language.  
My goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and build a solid foundation in Java programming.

Each project is kept simple, self-contained, and beginner-friendly. Over time, this repo will grow as I learn more advanced concepts. 💪
